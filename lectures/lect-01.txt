Basic definitions
9
• An asset is any tangible or intangible thing or characteristic that has value
to an organization [ISO/IEC 27000:2014].
• An attack vector is a path or means by which an attacker can gain access to a
computer or network server in order to deliver a malicious outcome [ISO
27032:2012].
• A vulnerability is a weakness of an asset (or control) that can be exploited by
one or more threats [ISO/IEC 27000:2016].
• An exploit is a method that identifies and takes advantage of a vulnerability in
an asset [Younis and Malaiya 2015].
• An attack is an attempt to destroy, expose, alter, disable, steal or gain
unauthorized access to or make unauthorized use of an asset [ISO
27000:2016].

Basic definitions

• Confidentiality is the property that information is not made available or disclosed to
unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes [ISO/IEC 27000:2016].
• Integrity is the property of safeguarding the accuracy and completeness of assets
[ISO/IEC 27000:2016].
• Availability is the property of being accessible
and usable upon demand by an authorized
entity [ISO/IEC 27000:2016].
Misuse & Abuse Cases
• Difference misuse vs. abuse
• What are they good for?
• How do they relate to threat modeling & risk assessment?
• Be able to apply to example
13
System Design & Threat Modeling
• Explain STRIDE properties and be able to understand data flow
diagrams
• Conduct a STRIDE per [element|interaction] analysis
• Define, name, and discuss trust boundaries
• What is distrustful decomposition?
• What are its benefits, what its challenges?
• Be able to apply distrustful decomposition to a model
• To what extent does platform XYZ support distrustful decomposition
(or not)?
14
Risk Assessment & Test Planning
• Definition of risk
• Factors that impact risk; relation to assets
• When is risk assessment best applied?
• How does risk assessment aid in test planning? How does it aid vuln.
assessment?
• Protection poker: What is it? How does it work? Be able to “play”
15
Defensive Coding
• What is defensive coding? Principles? Complexity? Attack Surface?
• What is sanitization? What types exist? What are possible pitfalls?
• In Java, why is cloning insecure?
• Why is deserialization a security risk?
• Etc. etc.
16
Defensive Coding - Overview of Principles
• Input
• Validation
• Sanitization
• Exception Handling
• Class Inheritance / Immutability / Cloning
• Concurrency
• Native Wrappers
• Global variables
• Serialization
• Unencrypted Storage
• Removal of unused sensitive data
• Character Conversions
• HTTP specs
• Config files
Code Inspection
• Process of manual code review
• Clean Code
• Test Driven Development
18
Correct usage of security mechanisms
• Security Code vs. Secure Code
• Code that implements security features vs. All code avoiding the introduction of
vulnerabilities
• Sanitizers
• Make untrusted (!) input safe for our context
• Don’t roll your own
• JWT
• Used for Authentication + session management
• But things can be missed:
• Trust of token contents without verification
• No signature validation
• Security Mechanisms must be…
• Configured correctly
• Used as intended
• Understood!
19
Applied Cryptography
• Encryption vs. Hashing vs. MAC vs. Signature
• Symmetric vs. asymmetric encryption; mixed-mode encryption
• Authentication with hashes (Passwords)
• What is a rainbow table? What is brute force? How to protect against
it?
20
Technique Goal
Encrpytion Confidentiality Protects from unauth. reading
Hashing Integrity One-way, same input -> same output
MACs Integrity, Authenticity Protects against manipulation
Signature Integrity, Authenticity, Non-repudiation same
Code Analysis – Static Analysis
• Whitebox vs Blackbox
• Taint Analysis
• Sources / Sinks / Sanitizers / Propagators
• Code Graph Representations (CPG, CFG, PDG, AST)
• Limitations
• Trade-Offs (Over vs Under approximation)
• Why do we need CFGs? What is a CPG? What is a Sink?
• How does it help to find injections, buffer overflows, etc.
21
Code Analysis – Dynamic Analysis
• Input Generation
• Fuzzing (randomness + mutations)
• Structured based on past experience (heuristics + border checks)
• Bug detection
• Observe crashes
• Error messages
• Responses
• Limitations
• How to detect an injection?
• How to know when to end?
22
Code Analysis – Greybox Analysis
• Smarter Input Generation
• Fuzzing (randomness + mutations)
• Structured based on past experience (heuristics + border checks)
• Usage of instrumentation feedback
• Bug detection
• Use instrumentation for bug detection
• Understanding the idea of ASan or Jazzer’s bug detection
• Limitations
• How to detect an injection?
• How to know when to end?
23
Vulnerability Assessment
• In CVSS, what are Base vs. Temporal vs. Environment metrics?
• Technical characteristics vs. threat over time vs. context
• Who defines which parts of a CVSS score?
• Name different metrics and their (not absolute ☺) impact on the
score
• What are limits of CVSS?
• Apply scoring to an example

A web-based document management system is used internally by a company.
The application is accessible over HTTPS from the company network but not directly from the public internet.
A vulnerability was discovered in the file upload component.
An authenticated user with standard user privileges can upload a specially crafted file that triggers a command
injection on the application server.
Exploiting the vulnerability:
•Does not require user interaction beyond the attacker
•Requires no special conditions
•Allows execution of arbitrary operating system commands
•Affects only the application server itself
•Can lead to:
• Reading sensitive configuration files
• Modifying application data ……..
