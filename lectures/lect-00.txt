Are we safer because of
these measures?
Security is not black &
white, it‘s a scale
Security comes at a cost,
usually privacy

In software engineering we teach you how to build software
…but not as much breaking software
How do you know that you have built a system that cannot be broken
into?
What evidence do you look for?
How do you know you’re done?

Important Terms
6
Asset
An asset is any tangible or intangible thing or characteristic that has
value to an organization [ISO/IEC 27000:2014].
7
Threat & Adversary
A threat is a potential cause of an unwanted incident, which may result in
harm to a system or organization [ISO/IEC 27000:2016].
An adversary is any person or a thing that acts (or has the power to act) to
cause, carry, transmit, or support a threat [Younis and Malaiya 2015].
8
Security & Security Policy
Security provides a form of protection where a separation is created between the
assets and the threat [OSSTMM 3].
A security policy is a definition of what it means to be secure for a system,
organization or other entity.
9
Safety vs. Security
• Safety is the absence of catastrophic consequences on the user(s)
and the environment [Avizienis et al. 2004].
• Security is concerned with the risks originating from the environment
and potentially impacting the system, whereas safety deals with the
risks arising from the system and potentially impacting the
environment [Piètre-Cambacédèsa & Chaudet 2010].
• Security typically addresses malicious risks while safety addresses
purely accidental risks [Piètre-Cambacédèsa & Chaudet 2010].
10
Challenges with term „Security“
• Exact definition depends on many factors and is specific to a given system
• Absolute statements such as “XY is secure” without providing the
assumptions they rely on is shady
• Typical security proofs work by reduction to assumptions that have not been refuted
yet despite huge efforts
• Often the underlying assumptions are too weak to draw such conclusions
• Beware of marketing promises!
• Hence we need to quantify security, but…
• Security is very hard to quantify
• “We are twice as secure as we were one year ago” does not make much sense
• Yet we need to decide faithfully how much we invest into security
11
Compliance vs. Security
• Compliance means to comply with certain rules, usually laws or
regulations.
• Security-compliance rules should align with security goals, but
sometimes they don‘t or there‘s unclear evidence as to how strongly
they support the security goals.
• Hence it is usually advisable but insufficient to be security-compliant
12
Example: Compliance vs. Security
13
• Banking app of a German bank (2018)
Example: Compliance vs. Security
14
• App was certified by TÜVRheinland
• Privacy/Data security
• This is a good sign!
Example: Compliance vs. Security
• At least three issues:
• Static Salt
• Only 20 rounds of hashing
• String used to store the password
15
• Code of the app:
Attack vector & Vulnerability
16
An attack vector is a path or means by which an attacker can gain access to a computer or
network server in order to deliver a malicious outcome [ISO 27032:2012].
A vulnerability is a weakness of an asset (or control) that can be exploited by one or more
threats [ISO/IEC 27000:2016].
Software Vulnerability
• Informally, a bug with security consequences
• A design flaw or poor coding that may allow an attacker to exploit
software for a malicious purpose
• E.g., allowing easily-guessed passwords (poor coding)
• E.g., complete lack of passwords when needed (design flaw)
• McGraw: 50% are coding mistakes, 50% are design flaws
• Alternative definition: “an instance of a mistake in the specification,
development, or configuration of software such that the execution
can violate the explicit or implicit security policy” [Ozment 2007].
17
Exploit & Attack
18
An exploit is a method that identifies and takes advantage of a vulnerability in an
asset [Younis and Malaiya 2015].
An attack is an attempt to destroy, expose, alter, disable, steal or gain
unauthorized access to or make unauthorized use of an asset [ISO 27000:2016].
Exploit
• Exploit – “a piece of software, a virus, a set of data, or sequence of
commands that takes advantage of a vulnerability in order to cause
unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur in software or an
embedded device. i.e. maliciously using a vulnerability” [Frei et al.
2010].
• Can be manual or automated
• Malware may contain automated exploits
• Exploits do not need to be malicious
• Many different ways to exploit just one vulnerability
19
Security Properties - Confidentiality
20
Confidentiality is the property that information is not made available or disclosed
to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes [ISO/IEC 27000:2016]. 
Security Properties - Integrity
21
Integrity is the property of safeguarding the accuracy and completeness of assets
[ISO/IEC 27000:2016].
Security Properties - Availability
22
Availability is the property of being accessible and usable upon demand by an
authorized entity [ISO/IEC 27000:2016].
Countermeasure & Mitigation
23
A countermeasure (or control / safeguard) is used to minimize or eliminate the probability of a
threat exploiting a vulnerability in an asset [Younis and Malaiya 2015].
Risk mitigation is the process of taking actions to eliminate or reduce the probability of
compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of valued information assets to
acceptable levels [MS-ISAC].

… cannot stop determined adversaries
• Protect against threats?
• Engineer secure software!
• Use forensics to find & eliminate
• Mitigate by punishment, if possible
… does not stop determined adversaries

Integrity
Security Properties (Security Objectives)
• Trusted Information (CIA triad)
• Confidentiality
• Integrity
• Availability
• Access Control (AAA principle)
• Authentication
• Authorization
• Accountability / Auditability / Non-Repudiation
27
Security Properties - Authentication
• Authentication is the provision of assurance that a claimed
characteristic of an entity is correct [ISO 27000:2016]
28
Example:
„Outside working hours,
persons shall authenticate
themselves (e.g., the museum
manager).“
Security Properties – Authorization
29
Authorization is a right or permission that is granted to a system entity
to access a system resource [IEC 62443-1-1, D6E4]
Example:
„The painting shall only
be accessible by
authorized persons
(that have paid).“
Security Properties – Accountability/Auditability/Non-Repudiation
30
Example:
„It shall be provable,
who had access to the
painting.“
Non-Repudiation is the ability to prove the occurrence of a claimed
event or action and its originating entities [ISO 27000:2016]

Cross-Site Request Forgery
32
Authorization vs. Authentication vs. Encryption
• Authentication:
• Seeks to assure who is issuing a request
• Typically involves checking the knowledge of a secret only the right
user/client/server can know
• Possible “secrets”: password, secret cryptographic key, fingerprint
• To not reveal the secret, the secret itself is never transmitted in plaintext, but
instead simply a proof that the secret is known
• More about this in Cryptography lectures!
• Authorization:
• Seeks to determine which permissions an authenticated user/client/server has
• Typically involves some kind of access-control lists
• Encryption:
• Quite a different concept, really: seeks to keep data confidential. More on this later
33
← CSRF exploits inconsistent authentication 
Cross-Site Request Forgery
• General Problem:
• Web application accepts state-modifying requests (typically GET) without
any sort of user authentication
• As a result, any web page running in the same browser can make those
requests on the user’s behalf

Cross-Site Request Forgery
• Mitigations:
• Modifying state only through POST requests is good practice but only makes
attacks a little harder, not impossible
• Better mitigations operate using tokens:
• Embed pseudo-random token (nonce) into form or cookie
• Check token when request is received at server
• Problem: requires additional, often stateful logic on the server
36
Cross-Site Request Forgery
• Real-world occurrence
• XSRF is generally a threat to any web application

Software Security is…
• NOT an arcane black art
• Much of it seems arcane
• Finding a severe vulnerability w/o source code
• Crafting the exploit
• Endless clever ways to break software
• But, initially you have much more knowledge about your software than the
attackers do
• Don’t just leave it to the experts, take responsibility for knowing security
43
Software Security is…
• Gradual: need to be able to decide what is probable more than what is
possible
• NOT a set of features
• Secure software > Security software
• Although tools and experts are helpful,
• You can’t just deploy a magical tool and expect all vulnerabilities to disappear
• You can’t outsource all of your security knowledge
• Even if you are using a security library, know how to use it properly
44
Software Security is…
• NOT a problem for just mathematicians
• Cryptography
• Is important and needed
• Cannot solve all of your security problems
• Pick-proof lock vs. open window
• Proofs, access control rules, and verification are
helpful, but inherently incomplete
45
Software Security is…
• NOT a problem for just networking and operating systems
• Software had security problems long before we had the internet
46
2015 DHS Study:
“90% of security
incidents result from
exploits against defects
in software”

Software Security is…
• NOT only about internet-connected applications
• Think of “security in depth”: if the first line of defense is breached, what
stops the attacker?
• Once the attacker is in, hopping to the next more valuable asset/system is easier,
typically
• Social Engineering and Phishing attacks
• “Lost” USB drives
• Insider threat (“Innentäter”)
→Company internal applications need software security as well!
47
Software Security is…
• NOT just about technology, but also about people and processes!
• People with low security awareness make mistakes that lead to
security issues.
• Poor processes lead to random behavior of people, hindering
controlled, effective and timely activities required for security.
• Poor technology leads to exploitable vulnerabilities.
48
Software Security is…
• A continuous challenge for everyone in an organization
• Not just developers, all stakeholders
• A learnable mindset for software engineers
• The ability to prevent unintended functionality
• At all layers of the software stack
• In all parts of your system
49
Security Maturity
(1) Denial
• I don’t have to think about this. Let me just code.
• Leave it to the experts.
• I could never understand this anyway.
(2) Irrational fear, superstition
• EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE NOW!!!
• EVERY MITIGATION IS NECESSARY!!!
• ENCRYPT EVERYTHING!!!
(3) Bag of Tricks
• Let’s just try these tricks that worked in the past
• We’ve done these 10 things. That’s a lot. Close enough, right?
(4) Reasoned, Balanced, Defensive Mindset
• If we do X, we mitigate Y, which is worthwhile because of Z.

Security Maturity Models
OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM)
• Assessment of software development security practices maturity
(like SPICE/CMMI for software development in general)
• Maturity Levels 0 to 3
• 0: Implicit starting point (activities/practices being unfulfilled)
• 1: Initial understanding and adhoc provision of security practices
• 2: Increased efficiency and/or effectiveness of security practices
• 3: Comprehensive mastery of the security practices at scale
